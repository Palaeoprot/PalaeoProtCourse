# Paleoproteomics Course Materials

## Course Overview

This repository contains materials for the **Introduction to Paleo- and Environmental Proteomics** course (March 17-21, 2025) held at the University of Tartu. The course provides a foundational introduction to paleoproteomics, focusing on software and computational methods used for data analysis of ancient proteins.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will:
- Understand the theoretical basis of paleoproteomics and its applications
- Gain knowledge of computational tools used in protein sequence identification and analysis
- Learn Python as a tool for proteomic data analysis
- Explore challenges in analyzing ancient protein data, including degradation patterns and contamination risks

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis exercises
- `lectures/`: Course lecture materials
- `data/`: Sample datasets for practical exercises
- `exercises/`: Hands-on exercises and instructions
- `resources/`: Additional reading materials and references

## Course Content

The course consists of daily lectures and practical sessions:

### Day 1 (17.3.2025)
- Introduction to paleoproteomics, ZooMS, and LC-MS/MS
- Overview of software tools for data analysis
- MassDebating: Review of literature and selection of presentation groups

### Day 2 (18.3.2025)
- Detailed instruction on mass spectrometry data processing
- Challenges in palaeoproteomic data interpretation
- MassDebating: Discussion of format for the session

### Day 3 (19.3.2025)
- Guided setup and analysis of pre-existing ZooMS data
- Case studies and troubleshooting
- Introduction to PRIDE and UNIPROT

### Day 4 (20.3.2025)
- Guided setup and analysis of pre-existing LC-MS/MS data
- Advanced analysis concepts, including spectral annotation
- Reporting and presenting findings from data analysis

### Day 5 (21.3.2025)
- Best practices in data deposition and accessibility
- MassDebate: Current condition and future perspectives in paleoproteomics

## Tools and Resources

The course focuses on several key tools:

- **NovorCloud**: For de novo peptide sequencing and protein identification
- **Python Libraries**: For data processing and visualization
- **PRIDE Database**: For accessing and depositing proteomics data
- **UniProt**: For protein sequence and functional information

## Practical Application Example

A key exercise in the course involves analyzing data from the following study:

Tuinstra, L. et al. Evidence for endogenous collagen in Edmontosaurus fossil bone. Anal. Chem. (2025) [doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.4c03115](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.4c03115).

This practical explores the controversial field of dinosaur protein analysis, addressing whether original proteins can be preserved over extremely long time periods.

## Metadata Standard

The course also covers a comprehensive data standard for archaeological and biomolecular research, including:
- Taxonomic identification
- Site and stratigraphic context
- Tissue and sample type
- Geospatial coordinates
- Dating information
- Sample preparation details
- Mass spectrometry parameters
